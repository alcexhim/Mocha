Build Web sites differently. Mocha (formerly known as [Objectify](https://github.com/alcexhim/Objectify) ) presents an object-oriented view of Web site development designed to appeal to hardcore programmers and traditional Web designers alike.

This is the ASP.NET implementation of Mocha. I have plans on eventually merging the PHP implementation and renaming that project permanently, because "Objectify" has too many negative connotations and frankly, "Mocha" sounds cooler... and makes a friendly reference to a similar object-oriented data framework. But for now, I'm focusing developing Mocha as a .NET application so that we can run it pretty much anywhere without too much extra hassle.
